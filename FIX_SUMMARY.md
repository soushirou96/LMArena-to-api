# Fix Summary: Authentication Endpoint Issue

## Problem
The userscript was failing to process requests from SillyTavern because LMArena requires an authentication cookie (`arena-auth-prod-v1`) to be present before API calls can be made. The ticket mentioned `/api/sign-up` returning 404, indicating that authentication was not being properly handled.

## Investigation
1. Reviewed the userscript code and found no existing authentication logic
2. Researched LMArena's authentication requirements
3. Discovered that LMArena uses `arena-auth-prod-v1` cookie for session authentication
4. Found that similar projects (like deanxv/lmarena2api) also rely on this cookie

## Solution Implemented
Added comprehensive authentication checking and initialization to the userscript:

### New Functions Added:
1. **`checkAuthCookie()`** - Checks if the required authentication cookie exists
2. **`ensureAuthentication()`** - Initializes authentication if missing by fetching the homepage

### Modified Functions:
1. **`connect()`** - Now checks authentication when WebSocket connection is established
2. **`executeFetchAndStreamBack()`** - Verifies authentication before making API calls

### Key Features:
- Automatic authentication detection and initialization
- Clear console logging for debugging
- Graceful error handling with helpful user messages
- Non-blocking implementation that doesn't interfere with existing functionality

## Changes Made:
1. **TampermonkeyScript/LMArenaApiBridge.js**
   - Added authentication state tracking (`isAuthenticated` flag)
   - Implemented cookie detection and session initialization
   - Version bumped from 2.5 to 2.6
   - Added authentication check before API requests
   - Enhanced console logging for authentication status

2. **.gitignore** (created)
   - Added standard Python and development environment exclusions
   - Protects sensitive config backups and logs

3. **AUTHENTICATION_FIX.md** (created)
   - Detailed documentation of the authentication fix
   - Technical details about the authentication flow
   - User guidance for troubleshooting

## Testing Recommendations:
1. Clear browser cookies for lmarena.ai
2. Reload the LMArena page with the updated userscript
3. Check browser console for authentication status messages
4. Expected: "✅ 检测到认证 cookie，认证已完成。" or session initialization success
5. Test API calls from SillyTavern to verify functionality

## Backward Compatibility:
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ No configuration changes required
- ✅ Existing sessions continue to work
- ✅ Automatic fallback if authentication fails
